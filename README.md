Special libraries often have a more specific clientele than libraries in traditional educational or public settings dealing with more specialized kinds of information. The study presents a view on special libraries which include corporate libraries, government libraries, law libraries, medical libraries, museum libraries, news libraries. Special libraries also exist within academic institutions, these libraries are included as special libraries because they are often funded separately from the rest of the university and they serve a targeted group of users.
